🔹 1. Define the Objective
Clarify what decisions the dashboard should support.

Example: Track sales performance by region, product, and month.

🔹 2. Gather & Structure Your Data
Collect raw data: sales transactions, product details, regional info, sales targets.

Store it in clean, normalized tables.

Recommended fields: Date, Product, Salesperson, Region, Units Sold, Revenue, Target.

🔹 3. Clean & Prepare the Data
Use functions like:

TRIM(), CLEAN() for text cleanup.

TEXT() for formatting dates.

IFERROR() to manage errors.

Create calculated columns:

Total Revenue = Units * Price

Achievement % = Revenue / Target

🔹 4. Create a Data Model
Use Excel Tables (Ctrl + T).

Relate tables using Power Pivot (if using multiple tables).

Optionally, load into Power Query for advanced cleaning.

🔹 5. Design KPIs & Metrics
Examples:

Total Sales

Sales vs. Target

% Growth (Month-over-Month)

Best/Worst Performing Region

🔹 6. Create Pivot Tables & Charts
Use Pivot Tables to summarize:

Sales by Month

Region-wise performance

Product trends

Use Pivot Charts (Column, Line, Pie, etc.).

🔹 7. Add Interactive Elements
Use Slicers for filtering by region/product/date.

Add Timelines for date-based filtering.

Consider Form Controls or drop-downs for custom interactivity.

🔹 8. Design the Dashboard Layout
Use separate sheet titled “Dashboard”.

Arrange KPIs at the top, charts below.

Use:

Shapes for headings

Icons or Conditional Formatting to highlight performance

Maintain consistent font, color scheme, and spacing.

🔹 9. Make it Dynamic
Add named ranges and use dynamic formulas:

OFFSET(), INDEX() + MATCH() combos

Use GETPIVOTDATA() for direct referencing from pivots.

🔹 10. Final Touches
Test interactivity.

Protect sheet (lock visuals, unlock slicers).

Add notes or legends where needed.

Export as PDF or share via OneDrive.
